If I followed Github Readme Template:


> 👀 I’m interested in getting rich with the minimum amound of effort possible. It happens that this minimum effort to me feels like a lot.
> 
> 🌱 I am reading books non stop. I discuss about them. I write blog about tech.
> 
> 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that will make me rich, or at least, have some exposure, so I could for once and for all by pass technical
> interviews. (See this github!, see this github! - or my company one EnlitrexAdmin, there's some public repos there too).
