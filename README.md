👋 Hi, I’m @FrancescJR  

Please take a look first here:
- [personal webpage](https://cesc.cool)  (the code is public in this repository)
- [blog webpage](https://blog.cesc.cool)

Also please take a look at my work for my own company: [Eniltrex](https://github.com/eniltrexAdmin)


If I followed Github Readme Template:


> 👀 I’m interested in getting rich with the minimum amound of effort possible. It happens that this minimum effort to me feels like a lot.
> 
> 🌱 I am reading books non stop. I discuss about them. I write blog about tech.
> 
> 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that will make me rich, or at least, have some exposure, so I could for once and for all by pass technical
> interviews. (See this github!, see this github! - or my company one EnlitrexAdmin, there's some public repos there too). 
>
> 📫 How to reach me, on  [linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesc-travesa-3a836130/) would be my preferred way.


The repositories here are mainly from technical challenges. You can take them or leave them. I am more proud of the work done in Eniltrex.
